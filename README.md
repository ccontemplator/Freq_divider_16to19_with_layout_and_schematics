The report include block diagram, schematic ,LAYOUT, DRC report, LVS report, aspect ratio, area , power, ,maximum frequency , FoM, of the design in some specific temperatures and corner(TT,FF,SS,SF,FS).

Hspice pre-sim, po-sim were implemented successfully, the waveform of each corner is also included.

Yeh, I know that layout is like a joke, it is tiring tho.
